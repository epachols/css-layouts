# css-layouts

A repository for CSS layouts/templates I have come across, for easy reproduction.

## Three-line-layouts

The dummy page found in the folder "three-line-layouts" contains three separate sections, each with separately-styled grid-containers. The last one involves entry transition animations. see basic-style.css for common styles to all (card, etc), and three-line-styles.css for specific ones.

note, the last layout and intro animation is a bit more complicated than 3 lines, but it's neat!
